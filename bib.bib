Although systems with an infinite number of strongly interacting degrees of freedom (in particle physics and critical phenomena) are hard to describe, they often demonstrate symmetries, in particular scale invariance. In two dimensions (2D) locality often extends scale invariance to a wider class of conformal transformations that allow non-uniform rescaling. Conformal invariance enables a thorough classification of universality classes of critical phenomena in 2D. Is there conformal invariance in 2D turbulence, a paradigmatic example of a strongly interacting non-equilibrium system? Here, we show numerically that some features of a 2D inverse turbulent cascade show conformal invariance. We observe that the statistics of vorticity clusters are remarkably close to that of critical percolation, one of the simplest universality classes of critical phenomena. These results represent a key step in the unification of 2D physics within the framework of conformal symmetry. ©2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

The diffusivity is close to κ=4, that is, isotemperature curves belong to the same universality class as domain walls in the O(2) spin model. Several statistics of temperature clusters and isolines are shown to agree with the theoretical expectations for such a spin system at criticality.

We have developed the analog of the vortex line representation as a transformation to the curvilinear system of coordinates moving together with the divorticity lines. Compressibility of this mapping can be considered as the main reason for the formation of the sharp vorticity gradients at high Reynolds numbers. For two-dimensional turbulence in the case of strong anisotropy the sharp vorticity gradients can generate spectra which fall off as k-3 at large k, resembling the Kraichnan spectrum for the enstrophy cascade. For turbulence with weak anisotropy the k dependence of the spectrum due to the sharp gradients coincides with the Saffman spectrum, E(k)∼k-4. We have compared the analytical predictions with direct numerical solutions of the two-dimensional Euler equation for decaying turbulence. We observe that the divorticity is reaching very high values and is distributed locally in space along piecewise straight lines, thus indicating strong anisotropy, and accordingly we find a spectrum close to the k-4 spectrum. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {We consider two-dimensional flow stirred by a small-scale, white-in-time random noise in the zero viscosity limit. Numerical simulations show that, after a transient state, an inertial-range energy spectrum E(k) ~ k with x =-, ~0.05 is established by the inverse cascade process. This range grows in time until a Bose condensate is formed at the largest scales in the system (k = 1). Prior to condensate formation the statistics of velocity diflerences are extremely close to Gaussian, and only after Bose condensation strong deviations from Gaussian statistics are detected at small scales. The structures responsible for this eA'ect are identified. High Reynolds number turbulent Aows are characterized by complexity, loosely defined as an intricate interplay of coherent and random dynamics. This makes the theoretical description of strong turbulence a major scientific challenge. The existence of coherent structures living in a random, structureless background has been demonstrated in numerous numerical and physical experiments. Their role is manifested in strong deviations from Gaussian values of the probability density functions (PDFs) of various turbulence quantities such as P(hu(r)), where hu(r) =u;(x+ri)-u;(x) and u; is the ith component of velocity u(x). Although the dynamics of the structures in turbulence have been a subject of intense interest during the last decade, the mechanisms governing their formation and behavior are not known. The problem is that a typical experiment, numerical or physical, deals with statistically steady Aows, characterized by several external parameters: The power of the energy source e and the wavelengths k"k;, kp, and kd corresponding to the system size, integral scale, energy-input scale, and dissipation scale, respectively. To stabilize the Aow, a viscous or other dissipation mechanism is always assumed for compensation of the energy input. It is clear that strong nonlinearity is necessary for structure generation. However, the following question must be asked: Is the nonlinear term solely responsible for strong deviations from Gaussian statistics, or do these deviations result from the combined action of nonlinearity and external parameters? Another question to be addressed is: What is the role of the largest, box-size eddies in coherent structure formation? This question is not simple since these eddies can, in principle, be responsible for symmetry breaking, the dynamical consequences of which are not addressed by a typical analytical theory of turbulence. In this Letter we attempt to answer some of these questions for the example of two-dimensional (2D) Aow driven by a white-in-time random force. We consider the Gaussian noise defined by the correlation function a(k'-k') (f;(k, t)fj(k', t')) ec2e d 6(k+k')8(t-t') kd-2 =D(k) ~(t-t') ~(k'-k. ').

In the 2D case there exists the additional law of enstrophy conservation. It is usually assumed that enstrophy conservation leads to a state of constant enstrophy flux J& for k)kp. This gives an energy spectrum in this region E(k) =k with x) 3. Kraichnan's theory [I] yields x =3 with logarithmic corrections, Safl'man [2] proposed x =4, and the recent conformal theory by Polyakov [3] gives x = 7', all satisfying the criterion governing the direction of the enstrophy flux toward small scales. It can also be shown that the energy Aux in this range is equal to zero. On the other hand, in the interval k (kp, the assumption of constant energy Aux leads to the Kolmogorov spectrum. Relation (2) gives that J(k) is a negative constant , and thus that energy Aows from small to large scales (inverse cascade). In what follows, we wish to reduce the number of external parameters that may be responsible for breaking the symmetries of the Euler equations. Therefore we consider scaling solutions in the limit of zero viscosity so that kd is eliminated from the problem.

   abstract = {Large-scale turbulence in fluid layers and other quasi-two-dimensional compressible systems consists of planar vortices and waves. Separately, wave turbulence usually produces a direct energy cascade, while solenoidal planar turbulence transports energy to large scales by an inverse cascade. Here, we consider turbulence at finite Mach numbers when the interaction between acoustic waves and vortices is substantial. We employ solenoidal pumping at intermediate scales and show how both direct and inverse energy cascades are formed starting from the pumping scale. We show that there is an inverse cascade of kinetic energy up to a scale $\ell$, where a typical velocity reaches the speed of sound; this creates shock waves, which provide for a compensating direct cascade. When the system size is less than $\ell$, the steady state contains a system-size pair of long-living condensate vortices connected by a system of shocks. Thus turbulence in fluid layers processes energy via a loop: Most energy first goes to large scales via vortices and is then transported by waves to small-scale dissipation.},

Specific theoretical predictions of spectra, structure functions, probability distributions, and mechanisms are presented, and major experimental and numerical comparisons are reviewed. The introduction of 3D perturbations does not destroy the main features of the cascade picture, implying that 2D turbulence phenomenology establishes the general picture of turbulent fluid flows when one spatial direction is heavily constrained by geometry or by applied body forces. Such flows are common in geophysical and planetary contexts, are beautiful to observe, and reflect the impact of dimensionality on fluid turbulence.},

   abstract = {Two-dimensional turbulence has both kinetic energy and mean-square vorticity as inviscid constants of motion. Consequently it admits two formal inertial ranges, E(k) ∼ ∈2/3k-5/3 and E(K) ∼ η2/3k-3, where ∈ is the rate of cascade of kinetic energy per unit mass, η is the rate of cascade of mean-square vorticity, and the kinetic energy per unit mass is ∫0∞E(k) dk. The The -5/3 range is found to entail backward energy cascade, from higher to lower wavenumbers k, together with zero-vorticity flow. The -3 range gives an upward vorticity flow and zero-energy flow. The paradox in these results is resolved by the irreducibly triangular nature of the elementary wavenumber interactions. The formal -3 range gives a nonlocal cascade and consequently must be modified by logarithmic factors. If energy is fed in at a constant rate to a band of wavenumbers ∼ki and the Reynolds number is large, it is conjectured that a quasi-steady-state results with a - 5/3 range for k ≪ ki and a -3 range for k ≫ ki, up to the viscous cutoff. The total kinetic energy increases steadily with time as the -5/3 range pushes to ever-lower k, until scales the size of the entire fluid are strongly excited.

   abstract = {Two-dimensional and three-dimensional turbulence have different properties, but both contain the two basic ingredients of randomness and convective nonlinearity, and some of the statistical hypotheses which have been proposed for three-dimensional turbulence should be applicable to two-dimensional motion. This justifies a numerical integration of the unaveraged equations of motion in two dimensions with random initial conditions as a means of testing the soundness of ideas such as those leading to the Kolmogoroff equilibrium theory. In spatially homogeneous two-dimensional turbulence, the mean-square vorticity is unaffected by convection and can only decrease under the action of viscosity. Consequently the rate of dissipation of energy tends to zero with the viscosity (υ). On the other hand, the mean-square vorticity gradient is increased by convective mixing, and it seems likely that the rate of decrease of mean-square vorticity tends to a nonzero limit χ as υ → 0. This suggests the existence of a "cascade" of mean-square vorticity at large Reynolds number, and an "equilibrium range" in the vorticity spectrum determined by the parameters χ and υ alone to which familiar dimensional arguments can be applied. Also, the energy and vorticity-containing components presumably settle down to an approximate similarity state determined by the total energy alone. A numerical integration of the equation of motion to test such similarity relations was attempted at Cambridge some years ago by R. W. Bray. The velocity distribution was represented by spectral lines at vector wavenumbers of the form (p, q), where p and q are integers and (p2 + q2)1/2 < 10, and the integration was carried out to times at which an appreciable amount of vorticity had been transferred to the larger wavenumbers. The results obtained with the rather small computing machine available at the time were not decisive, but they were consistent with the development of the expected k-1 form of the vorticity spectrum.},

   abstract = {The simplicity of fundamental physical laws manifests itself in fundamental symmetries. Although systems with an infinite number of strongly interacting degrees of freedom (in particle physics and critical phenomena) are hard to describe, they often demonstrate symmetries, in particular scale invariance. In two dimensions (2D) locality often extends scale invariance to a wider class of conformal transformations that allow non-uniform rescaling. Conformal invariance enables a thorough classification of universality classes of critical phenomena in 2D. Is there conformal invariance in 2D turbulence, a paradigmatic example of a strongly interacting non-equilibrium system? Here, we show numerically that some features of a 2D inverse turbulent cascade show conformal invariance. We observe that the statistics of vorticity clusters are remarkably close to that of critical percolation, one of the simplest universality classes of critical phenomena. These results represent a key step in the unification of 2D physics within the framework of conformal symmetry. ©2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

We show that temperature isolines are statistically equivalent to curves that can be mapped into a one-dimensional Brownian walk (called Schramm-Loewner evolution or SLEκ). The diffusivity is close to κ=4, that is, isotemperature curves belong to the same universality class as domain walls in the O(2) spin model. Several statistics of temperature clusters and isolines are shown to agree with the theoretical expectations for such a spin system at criticality. We also show that the direct cascade in two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence is not conformal invariant. The emerging picture is that conformal invariance may be expected for inverse turbulent cascades of strongly interacting systems. © 2007 The American Physical Society.},

The vorticity is measured by tracking the motion of particles that float at the surface of a turbulent tank of water. The three-dimensional turbulence in the tank has a Taylor microscale Reλ ≃ 160. The conformal invariance theory being tested here is related to the behavior of equilibrium systems near a critical point. This theory is associated with the work of Löwner, Schramm and others and is usually referred to as Schramm-Löwner evolution (SLE). The system was exposed to several tests of SLE. The results of these tests suggest that zero-vorticity isolines exhibit noticeable departures from this type of conformal invariance. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

The class is characterized by a linear relation between the transported field and the velocity, and include several cases of physical interest, such as Navier-Stokes, surface quasi-geostrophic and Charney-Hasegawa-Mima equations. We find that some statistical properties of the inverse turbulent cascades in such systems are conformal invariant. In particular, the zero-isolines of the scalar field are statistically equivalent to conformal invariant curves within the resolution of our numerics. We show that the choice of the conformal class is determined by the properties of a transporting velocity rather than those of a transported field and discover a phase transition when the velocity turns from a large-scale field to a small-scale one.},

   abstract = {The appearance of sharp vorticity gradients in two-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence and their influence on the turbulent spectra are considered. We have developed the analog of the vortex line representation as a transformation to the curvilinear system of coordinates moving together with the divorticity lines. Compressibility of this mapping can be considered as the main reason for the formation of the sharp vorticity gradients at high Reynolds numbers. For two-dimensional turbulence in the case of strong anisotropy the sharp vorticity gradients can generate spectra which fall off as k-3 at large k, resembling the Kraichnan spectrum for the enstrophy cascade. For turbulence with weak anisotropy the k dependence of the spectrum due to the sharp gradients coincides with the Saffman spectrum, E(k)∼k-4. We have compared the analytical predictions with direct numerical solutions of the two-dimensional Euler equation for decaying turbulence. We observe that the divorticity is reaching very high values and is distributed locally in space along piecewise straight lines, thus indicating strong anisotropy, and accordingly we find a spectrum close to the k-4 spectrum. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {We consider two-dimensional flow stirred by a small-scale, white-in-time random noise in the zero viscosity limit. Numerical simulations show that, after a transient state, an inertial-range energy spectrum E(k) ~ k with x =-, ~0.05 is established by the inverse cascade process. This range grows in time until a Bose condensate is formed at the largest scales in the system (k = 1). Prior to condensate formation the statistics of velocity diflerences are extremely close to Gaussian, and only after Bose condensation strong deviations from Gaussian statistics are detected at small scales. The structures responsible for this eA'ect are identified. High Reynolds number turbulent Aows are characterized by complexity, loosely defined as an intricate interplay of coherent and random dynamics. This makes the theoretical description of strong turbulence a major scientific challenge. The existence of coherent structures living in a random, structureless background has been demonstrated in numerous numerical and physical experiments. Their role is manifested in strong deviations from Gaussian values of the probability density functions (PDFs) of various turbulence quantities such as P(hu(r)), where hu(r) =u;(x+ri)-u;(x) and u; is the ith component of velocity u(x). Although the dynamics of the structures in turbulence have been a subject of intense interest during the last decade, the mechanisms governing their formation and behavior are not known. The problem is that a typical experiment, numerical or physical, deals with statistically steady Aows, characterized by several external parameters: The power of the energy source e and the wavelengths k"k;, kp, and kd corresponding to the system size, integral scale, energy-input scale, and dissipation scale, respectively. To stabilize the Aow, a viscous or other dissipation mechanism is always assumed for compensation of the energy input. It is clear that strong nonlinearity is necessary for structure generation. However, the following question must be asked: Is the nonlinear term solely responsible for strong deviations from Gaussian statistics, or do these deviations result from the combined action of nonlinearity and external parameters? Another question to be addressed is: What is the role of the largest, box-size eddies in coherent structure formation? This question is not simple since these eddies can, in principle, be responsible for symmetry breaking, the dynamical consequences of which are not addressed by a typical analytical theory of turbulence. In this Letter we attempt to answer some of these questions for the example of two-dimensional (2D) Aow driven by a white-in-time random force. We consider the Gaussian noise defined by the correlation function a(k'-k') (f;(k, t)fj(k', t')) ec2e d 6(k+k')8(t-t') kd-2 =D(k) ~(t-t') ~(k'-k. ').

We will assume that the variation of p(z) from (3) where J(k) is the energy flux and K(k) = ft, E(z)dz. Equation (2) satisfies the natural boundary condition J(k) 0 when E(k) 0 fast enough as k ~. In the 2D case there exists the additional law of enstrophy conservation. It is usually assumed that enstrophy conservation leads to a state of constant enstrophy flux J& for k)kp. This gives an energy spectrum in this region E(k) =k with x) 3. Kraichnan's theory [I] yields x =3 with logarithmic corrections, Safl'man [2] proposed x =4, and the recent conformal theory by Polyakov [3] gives x = 7', all satisfying the criterion governing the direction of the enstrophy flux toward small scales. It can also be shown that the energy Aux in this range is equal to zero. On the other hand, in the interval k (kp, the assumption of constant energy Aux leads to the Kolmogorov spectrum. Relation (2) gives that J(k) is a negative constant , and thus that energy Aows from small to large scales (inverse cascade). In what follows, we wish to reduce the number of external parameters that may be responsible for breaking the symmetries of the Euler equations. Therefore we consider scaling solutions in the limit of zero viscosity so that kd is eliminated from the problem. Since fp J(k) =0, one sees from (2) that a steady state is impossible when v =0 because the total energy E (k, t) = et ~ for t ~.

   abstract = {Large-scale turbulence in fluid layers and other quasi-two-dimensional compressible systems consists of planar vortices and waves. Separately, wave turbulence usually produces a direct energy cascade, while solenoidal planar turbulence transports energy to large scales by an inverse cascade. Here, we consider turbulence at finite Mach numbers when the interaction between acoustic waves and vortices is substantial. We employ solenoidal pumping at intermediate scales and show how both direct and inverse energy cascades are formed starting from the pumping scale. We show that there is an inverse cascade of kinetic energy up to a scale $\ell$, where a typical velocity reaches the speed of sound; this creates shock waves, which provide for a compensating direct cascade. When the system size is less than $\ell$, the steady state contains a system-size pair of long-living condensate vortices connected by a system of shocks. Thus turbulence in fluid layers processes energy via a loop: Most energy first goes to large scales via vortices and is then transported by waves to small-scale dissipation.},

Here we discuss the novel effects arising from the consideration of fluid turbulence confined to two spatial dimensions. The additional conservation constraint on squared vorticity relative to three-dimensional (3D) turbulence leads to the dual-cascade scenario of Kraichnan and Batchelor with an inverse energy cascade to larger scales and a direct enstrophy cascade to smaller scales. Specific theoretical predictions of spectra, structure functions, probability distributions, and mechanisms are presented, and major experimental and numerical comparisons are reviewed. The introduction of 3D perturbations does not destroy the main features of the cascade picture, implying that 2D turbulence phenomenology establishes the general picture of turbulent fluid flows when one spatial direction is heavily constrained by geometry or by applied body forces. Such flows are common in geophysical and planetary contexts, are beautiful to observe, and reflect the impact of dimensionality on fluid turbulence.},

The overview of the laboratory experiments on quasi-two-dimensional turbulence is restricted to include only those carried out in thin electromagnetically forced shallow fluid layers and in stratified fluids. The effects of the quasi-twodimensional character of the turbulence in the laboratory experiments will be discussed briefly.

   abstract = {Two-dimensional turbulence has both kinetic energy and mean-square vorticity as inviscid constants of motion. Consequently it admits two formal inertial ranges, E(k) ∼ ∈2/3k-5/3 and E(K) ∼ η2/3k-3, where ∈ is the rate of cascade of kinetic energy per unit mass, η is the rate of cascade of mean-square vorticity, and the kinetic energy per unit mass is ∫0∞E(k) dk. The The -5/3 range is found to entail backward energy cascade, from higher to lower wavenumbers k, together with zero-vorticity flow. The -3 range gives an upward vorticity flow and zero-energy flow. The paradox in these results is resolved by the irreducibly triangular nature of the elementary wavenumber interactions. The formal -3 range gives a nonlocal cascade and consequently must be modified by logarithmic factors. If energy is fed in at a constant rate to a band of wavenumbers ∼ki and the Reynolds number is large, it is conjectured that a quasi-steady-state results with a - 5/3 range for k ≪ ki and a -3 range for k ≫ ki, up to the viscous cutoff. The total kinetic energy increases steadily with time as the -5/3 range pushes to ever-lower k, until scales the size of the entire fluid are strongly excited. The rate of energy dissipation by viscosity decreases to zero if kinematic viscosity is decreased to zero with other parameters unchanged.},

   abstract = {Two-dimensional and three-dimensional turbulence have different properties, but both contain the two basic ingredients of randomness and convective nonlinearity, and some of the statistical hypotheses which have been proposed for three-dimensional turbulence should be applicable to two-dimensional motion. This justifies a numerical integration of the unaveraged equations of motion in two dimensions with random initial conditions as a means of testing the soundness of ideas such as those leading to the Kolmogoroff equilibrium theory. In spatially homogeneous two-dimensional turbulence, the mean-square vorticity is unaffected by convection and can only decrease under the action of viscosity. Consequently the rate of dissipation of energy tends to zero with the viscosity (υ). On the other hand, the mean-square vorticity gradient is increased by convective mixing, and it seems likely that the rate of decrease of mean-square vorticity tends to a nonzero limit χ as υ → 0. This suggests the existence of a "cascade" of mean-square vorticity at large Reynolds number, and an "equilibrium range" in the vorticity spectrum determined by the parameters χ and υ alone to which familiar dimensional arguments can be applied. Also, the energy and vorticity-containing components presumably settle down to an approximate similarity state determined by the total energy alone. A numerical integration of the equation of motion to test such similarity relations was attempted at Cambridge some years ago by R. W. Bray. The velocity distribution was represented by spectral lines at vector wavenumbers of the form (p, q), where p and q are integers and (p2 + q2)1/2 < 10, and the integration was carried out to times at which an appreciable amount of vorticity had been transferred to the larger wavenumbers. The results obtained with the rather small computing machine available at the time were not decisive, but they were consistent with the development of the expected k-1 form of the vorticity spectrum.},

abstract = {In this study, we present an immersed boundary reconstruction method for the simulation of viscous compressible flows presenting strong discontinuities in the vicinity of the immersed body. The technique we propose is based on a weighted least-square reconstruction. Its major feature is that the weights are automatically adapted to the presence of a discontinuity within the least-square stencil by using a shock-sensor approach. In so doing, the reconstruction becomes ENO-like and mathematically consistent even in the presence of strong discontinuities. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that it then becomes possible to use an immersed boundary method for the simulation of hypersonic flows and that it is robust, even for flows around complex geometries. To do so, two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved to study canonical hypersonic flows and it is showed that the results are in good agreement with either experimental data and/or body-fitted approaches and that the impact of the immersed boundary technique on the overall spatial order of convergence is reasonable.}
