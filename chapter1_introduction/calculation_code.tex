\section{Calculation code}


The main goal  of this project at CEA is to create a new simulation code in the context of fast design of atmospheric reentry vehicles. To do so, we must develop a 3D simulation code and run simulations like this double ellipsoid at mach 8. We need to compute some discontinuities like shock wave with robust numerical methods. We need to capture precisely the variables like the heat flux near the wall body and also describe as much as possible the turbulence phenomena. We use only Cartesian grid and the sharp immersed boundary method to reduce mesh generation around complex geometries.  In addition, to gain precision in the description of physical phenomena, we have developed several computational  methods such as high order reconstruction. One of the biggest challenge of this project, is that  to set up the simulation parameter, to choose the best numerical method to take into account the calculations cost and accuracy calculation. The two main fluid Dynamics ingredients are the reconstruction  to compute variables like density on the faces, and the resolution of the Riemann problem to compute the variables inside the cells with a Riemann solver.
