Flow turbulence is a phenomenon of major importance in fluid dynamics.
It is characterized by chaotic changes in the motion of a flow (\emph{e.g.}
typical cigarette smoke patterns), which have a drastic impact in numerous
applications (aeronautics, weather forecast, climate modeling, material
sciences, astronomy, etc.).
Although turbulence has been studied since the early stages of modern physics,
its theoretical mastery remains incomplete \cite{baez2006} and the
understanding of the
Navier-Stokes equations, central
in the description of
% to
fluid motion, is still
considered as
a
% one of the
major open challenge in mathematics and physics,
as proven by the Clay Mathematics Institute selecting it to be
% and
% has been selected by
among its celebrated Millennium Prize problems \cite{fefferman2000}.
Thus, in engineering applications, the main practical solution available for
the study of turbulence
% and turbulent flows
remains numerical simulation.

\noindent
\textbf{Problem introduction:}
However,
% plenty of
many
different numerical solvers can be used to simulate a given flow configuration, each
solver being itself subject to several input parameters (such as domain
resolution, interpolation scheme and order, etc.): when faced with such a wide variety,
% \julien
the main problem for users becomes
the configuration itself of the simulation parameters.
% to choose the right solver.
% Then, the problem of evaluating and comparing the performance of different solver configurations is
% of major importance.
In particular, domain experts want not only to identify
the solver configurations which produce the most realistic simulations, but
they also want to discover configurations resulting in
degraded but fast
% fast, degraded
computations, which still produce simulations of acceptable realism. The
fundamental problem behind such comparative analyses is that of comparing
\emph{quantitatively} turbulent flows. For instance, the quantitative realism
of a simulation could be evaluated by comparing its outcome to a reference,
either obtained by acquisition or by a highly detailed simulation considered as
a ground-truth. However, the chaotic nature of turbulent flows makes their direct
comparison with standard imaging tools
% (\emph{e.g.} the $L_2$ norm, \autoref{fig_teaser})
impractical. For instance, turbulent flows which are considered similar at a
high level by domain experts (in terms of the number and size of their vortices)
are reported by classical metrics such as the $L_2$ norm as being very distant
(\autoref{fig_teaser}), as such pointwise measures are sensitive to mild
geometrical variations in the data and miss global structural
similarities in such a chaotic context. This observation motivates the
consideration of alternative similarity estimation tools, which focus on the
\emph{structure} of the flow, rather than its raw geometry.

In that regard, Topological Data Analysis (TDA) \cite{edelsbrunner09} forms a
family of generic, robust and efficient techniques, whose purpose is precisely
to recover hidden implicit structural patterns in complex data, and to enable
their reliable representation and comparison. As such, they provide
potentially relevant alternatives to standard comparison measures used in
scientific imaging, such as the $L_2$ norm. Moreover, the utility of TDA has
been already demonstrated in a number of analysis and visualization tasks
\cite{heine16}, with examples of successful applications in
combustion \cite{laney_vis06, bremer_tvcg11, gyulassy_ev14},
material sciences \cite{gyulassy_vis07, gyulassy_vis15, favelier16},
% fluid dynamics \cite{kasten_tvcg11},
bioimaging \cite{carr04, topoAngler, beiBrain18},
quantum chemistry \cite{chemistry_vis14, harshChemistry, Malgorzata19}, or
astrophysics \cite{sousbie11, shivashankar2016felix}. In
particular, the critical points of flow vorticity indicators have been
reported to appropriately capture the center of vortices \cite{kasten_tvcg11,
bridel_ldav19}, as well as their importance, with the notion of
\emph{topological persistence} \cite{edelsbrunner02}. Such  results provide
additional evidence and consolidate the intuition that TDA could be a
relevant framework for comparing turbulent flows.

The ambition of this application paper is to provide a comprehensive
experimental evaluation of

the above intuition, i.e. to assess the suitability of
topological data representations and their associated analysis tools for the
quantitative comparisons of turbulent flows.
%We shall focus on a peculiar type of turbulence that expresses itself in two dimensions (akin to the soap-film turbulence displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:soapfilm}): it is a fair representative of generic turbulence (\emph{a.k.a.} three-dimensional viscous turbulence) and allows for affordable high-resolution simulations to feed our study.

Specifically, our study documents
the usage of the persistence diagram of the maxima of flow enstrophy (an established indicator of vorticity for two-dimensional flows,
\autoref{sec_background}) for the topological representation of 180 members of
an ensemble of hydrodynamic turbulent flows, generated by a coarse sampling of
the parameter space of five distinct solvers.
We document five main hypotheses (\autoref{sec_caseStudy}) reported by domain
experts, describing their expectations with regard to the variability among the
flows generated by the distinct solver configurations.
Then, we describe three evaluation protocols (\autoref{sec_protocols}) designed
to assess the validation of the above hypotheses by standard comparison
measures ($L_2$ norm) on one hand, and by topological methods on the other.
Specifically, these protocols exploit the persistence curve, the
$L_2$-Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams \cite{Turner2014} and
$k$-means in the $L_2$-Wasserstein metric space \cite{vidal_vis19}. Finally, we

our study bring a strong experimental evidence of the suitability
of TDA for representing and comparing turbulent flows, thereby providing
confidence in its usage by the fluid dynamics community in the future.
Moreover, our flow data and evaluation protocols provide to the TDA community
an application-approved benchmark for the evaluation and design of further
topological distances in the future.

Turbulence is ubiquitous in nature, at all scales, from Higgs-Boson condensates \cite{Kraichnan1967} to a stirred cup of coffee to geophysical flows \cite{Kraichnan1980} to galaxy formation.
While a significant literature in graphics \cite{KimTJG08, ZhangLSSQ14, BaiWDL21} focused on the efficient generation of visually plausible turbulence, we focus in this work on the direct numerical simulation of the underlying physical equations, for engineering applications.
% One motivation to study turbulence, and in particular two-dimensional turbulence, shared by all investigators is that despite its practical applications, its omnipresence and the years of scrutiny it was subjected to, remains one of the most important unsolved problems of classical mechanics.
A special distinction of 2D turbulence is that it is never realized in nature that, unless strongly constrained,
%\cite{Danilov2002},
always has some degree of three-dimensionality but rather it only exists in computer simulations.
Two-dimensional turbulence has thus been studied extensively by the latter means \emph{e.g.} for its importance as an idealization of meteorological flows \cite{Boffetta2011}, its role in the confinement of thermonuclear plasmas \cite{Kraichnan1980} but also as a cost-effective numerical testing ground for three-dimensional flows dynamical theories \cite{Tabeling2002}.
Most such studies focus either on validating predictions of theorists \cite{Kraichnan1967,lilly1989two} or on providing insights into the dynamic behavior of 2D eddies thanks to high-resolution simulations \cite{lilly1989two,Maltrud1991}.
The simulations are usually analyzed by considering macroscopic quantities such as the enstrophy (see below equation~\eqref{eq:enstrophy}), or by considering the Fourier decomposition of the 2D field (similar to \autoref{energie})- integral indicators that make it near impossible to compare and/or classify the results of, say, a parametric study.
% These classical indicators all integrate the data to some extent and, faced with two numerical realizations produced using different numerical settings, make it near impossible to classify the results.
Some efforts have been made recently \cite{san2015evaluation} to provide the users with some guidelines to best choose the numerical methods and parameters for the simulation of 2D turbulence, but still using, mostly, the aforementioned integral, inaccurate, indicators.
The present study aims at providing the workers in 2D turbulence with another tool to classify their results and best choose their settings, this time using mostly local indicators able to exploit the whole flow.

\noindent
\textbf{\emph{(ii)} Topological methods for ensemble analysis.}
Concepts and algorithms from computational topology \cite{edelsbrunner09} have
been investigated, adapted and extended by the visualization community for more
than twenty years \cite{heine16}. Specifically, a large body of literature has
been dedicated to the analysis and visualization of flow data with
topological methods and we refer the readers to a series of surveys on the topic
\cite{ScheuermannT05, GarthT06,
LarameeHZP07, PobitzerPFSKTMH11,
wang2016,
BujackYHGW20},
including a
recent iteration \cite{flowIntro21}.
A substantial line of work
\cite{petz, otto2, otto1} focused on extending topological techniques to
uncertain vector fields, where flow variability is encoded via a pointwise
estimator (\emph{e.g.} an histogram) of an \emph{a priori} vector distribution, but only few
techniques explicitly focused on the analysis of flow variability in an
ensemble.
Specifically, several comparative visualization techniques have been
proposed \cite{filip3, schneider2012,Hummel2013, GuoHPSCH16, JaremaKW16, filip2, filip1, LohfinkG20}. Ferstl et al.
\cite{Ferstl2016} investigated the global structure of flow ensembles, by
proposing a  clustering approach of the  members, based on a measure of
streamline similarity.
However, these techniques assume a mild
geometrical variability within the ensemble and are therefore
% are
not suited to highly
turbulent flows as studied in this work, where the geometry of the features
(streamlines, vortices) chaotically changes from one ensemble
member to the other (\autoref{fig_teaser}), even upon only slight variations of
the simulation input parameters.
In certain application contexts, CFD experts often prefer to focus their analysis on (simpler to interpret) scalar descriptors generated from the flow, such as the kinetic energy (\autoref{energie}) or the enstrophy (\autoref{eq:enstrophy}). Such a transition to a scalar descriptor enables them to leverage the existing tools for scalar data analysis.
% In several applications, the features of interest in the flow can be reliably
% represented by considering a single pointwise scalar descriptor, such as
% pressure, energy or an estimation of vorticity for instance.
% Such a transition to a scalar descriptor of the flow enables users to leverage
% the ensemble of existing tools for scalar data analysis.
For instance, several
authors \cite{kasten_tvcg11, bridel_ldav19} have shown that, given a relevant
vorticity scalar descriptor, the center of the flow vortices could be reliably
extracted and tracked over time, which supports the idea that
topological methods for scalar data can be useful for the description of
specific flow features. Thus, in the following, we describe the literature
related to topological methods for scalar data.
Popular topological representations include the persistence diagram
\cite{edelsbrunner02, edelsbrunner09}
% (\autoref{fig_mergeTree}),
which represents the
population of features of interest in function of their salience, and which
can be computed via matrix reduction
\cite{edelsbrunner09, dipha}. The Reeb graph \cite{biasotti08}, which describes
the connectivity evolution of level sets, has also been widely studied and
several efficient algorithms have been documented \cite{pascucci07,
tierny_vis09, parsa12, DoraiswamyN13}, including parallel algorithms
\cite{gueunet_egpgv19}.
Efficient algorithms have also been documented for its variants,
% including
the
merge and contour trees \cite{tarasov98, carr00}
and parallel algorithms have
also been described \cite{MaadasamyDN12, AcharyaN15,
CarrWSA16, gueunet_tpds19}. The Morse-Smale complex \cite{EdelsbrunnerHZ01,
EdelsbrunnerHNP03,
BremerEHP03}, which depicts the
global behavior of integral lines, is another popular topological data
abstraction in visualization \cite{Defl15}. Robust and efficient algorithms
have been introduced for its computation  \cite{robins_pami11, ShivashankarN12,
gyulassy_vis18} based on Discrete Morse Theory \cite{forman98}.
Inspired by the literature in
optimal transport \cite{Kantorovich, monge81}, the Wasserstein distance between
persistence diagrams \cite{edelsbrunner09}
(and its variant the
Bottleneck distance \cite{edelsbrunner02}) have been extensively studied.
% This distance
% is based on a bipartite assignment problem.
In
practice, it enables users to compare ensemble members based on their
persistence diagrams.
In our experimental study, we focus on this first, established topological tool
for comparing the topology of ensemble members and we refer the reader to a
recent survey \cite{YanMSRNHW21} for a description of alternative metrics
between topological descriptors.
Several techniques have been proposed for summarizing the topological features
in an ensemble or analyzing their variability.
% For instance,
Favelier et al.
\cite{favelier2018} and Athawale et al. \cite{athawale_tvcg19} introduced
approaches for analyzing the variability of critical points and
gradient separatrices respectively. Recent approaches aimed at summarizing
an ensemble of topological descriptors by computing a notion of \emph{average}
% topological
descriptor,
% with respect to
given a specific metric.
% Such a
This notion has
been well studied for persistence diagrams \cite{Turner2014,
lacombe2018, vidal_vis19}, with direct applications to ensemble clustering
\cite{vidal_vis19}, and analogies have been developed for merge
trees \cite{YanWMGW20, pont_vis21}.
